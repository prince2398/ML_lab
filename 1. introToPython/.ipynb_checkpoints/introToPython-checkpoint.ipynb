    "#### THEORY :\n",
    "Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.\n",
    "* **Python is Interpreted** − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n",
    "* **Python is Interactive** − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n",
    "* **Python is Object-Oriented** − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n",
    "* **Python is a Beginner's Language** − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games."
